  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

  <p>By installing or using AutoInv ("the add-on", "the service"), you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the add-on.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>AutoInv is a Google Workspace Add-on for Google Sheets that extracts structured data from invoice text using artificial intelligence. It offers a free tier (manual extraction) and a paid Pro tier (Gmail auto-import, scheduling, and duplicate detection).</p>

  <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By installing AutoInv from the Google Workspace Marketplace, you agree to these terms and to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. You must have a Google account and be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use the add-on.</p>

  <h2>3. Free and Paid Tiers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Free tier</strong> includes manual paste-and-extract functionality at no cost.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Pro tier</strong> includes additional features (Gmail auto-import, hourly scheduling, duplicate detection) and requires a paid subscription through the Google Workspace Marketplace.</li>
    <li>Pricing is set via the Google Workspace Marketplace and may change. We will provide reasonable notice before any price increases for existing subscribers.</li>
    <li>Refunds and billing are managed by Google according to their <a href="https://workspace.google.com/terms/marketplace_tos.html" target="_blank">Marketplace Terms of Service</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for the data you process through AutoInv, including ensuring you have the right to process any invoices or emails.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for keeping your Groq API key secure. Do not share it with others.</li>
    <li>You agree not to use the add-on for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for reviewing extracted data for accuracy before relying on it for business decisions, tax filings, or other important purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
  <p>AutoInv uses AI to extract data from unstructured text. While we strive for accuracy:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Extraction results may contain errors, especially with unusual invoice formats, handwritten text, or non-English invoices.</li>
    <li>The add-on is a productivity tool, not a substitute for professional accounting or bookkeeping review.</li>
    <li>We recommend reviewing extracted data before using it for financial, legal, or tax purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Availability</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We aim to keep the service available but do not guarantee uptime or uninterrupted access.</li>
    <li>The add-on depends on Google Apps Script, Gmail, and the Groq API — outages in any of these services may affect functionality.</li>
    <li>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time with reasonable notice.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AutoInv and its code, design, and documentation are the intellectual property of the developer.</li>
    <li>Your data remains yours. We claim no ownership over any data you process through the add-on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AutoInv is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong>, without warranties of any kind, express or implied.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages arising from your use of the add-on, including but not limited to data loss, incorrect extractions, or business interruption.</li>
    <li>Our total liability for any claim related to the service shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Pro subscription in the 12 months prior to the claim.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>AutoInv uses the Groq API for AI processing. Your use of the add-on is also subject to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://groq.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank">Groq Terms of Use</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://workspace.google.com/terms/marketplace_tos.html" target="_blank">Google Workspace Marketplace Terms of Service</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Termination</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may stop using AutoInv at any time by uninstalling it from your Google Sheet.</li>
    <li>We may terminate or suspend your access if you violate these terms.</li>
    <li>Upon termination, your data remains in your Google Sheet. We do not delete your spreadsheet data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the add-on after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

  <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Spain. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Spain.</p>
